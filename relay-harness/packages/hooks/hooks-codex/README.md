# @deepseek-ai/dsh-hooks-codex

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

A cordis plugin that runs the supported subset of a user's existing **Codex** hook config on the harness's canonical interception points. The **Codex dialect** half of the hooks subsystem. The dialect-agnostic primitives come from [`@deepseek-ai/dsh-hook-protocol`](../hook-protocol/README.md); this bridge owns the Codex-shaped payloads, matcher mode, and decision mapping.

This bridge implements a deliberate subset of Codex's current hook protocol:

- **Five of ten hook points:** `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and `Stop`.
- **Regex-only matchers** (no literal fast path; the matcher is always an unanchored regex).
- **snake_case stdin payloads** with `turn_id`/`model` extras, written **without** a trailing newline.
- **No Codex plugin env injection and no config-time placeholder substitution** (the command still receives the executor's environment and runs through its shell).
- **No pre-tool approval or rewrite path** — a hook can block, but the bridge does not pre-approve or replace tool input.

A native cordis plugin could do everything this bridge does, more powerfully; the bridge exists only as a compatibility path for the mapped Codex subset (see [the interception extension-points Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-06-30-interception-extension-points.md)).

## Config

```ts
import type { Config } from '@deepseek-ai/dsh-hooks-codex'
const config: Config = {
  configPath: '/path/to/.codex/hooks.json', // required
  model: 'deepseek-v4',                      // optional: stamped on every payload (Codex includes `model`)
  defaultTimeoutMs: 600_000,                 // optional: per-hook timeout when a hook sets none
  stderrSummaryMaxChars: 500,                // optional: char cap on the hook/result event's persisted stderr summary
}
```

In a `cordis.yml`:

```yaml
- dsh-hooks-codex:
    configPath: ./.codex/hooks.json
    model: deepseek-v4
```

An absolute `configPath` names one shared file. A relative path is discovered independently for each session: starting at `session.header.cwd`, the bridge checks that path at each ancestor through the nearest directory containing `.git`, without crossing that project root; agent-less calls start at the process cwd. Paths containing `..` are rejected. Parsed configs are cached by absolute path plus filesystem identity, size, mtime, and ctime, so different workspaces stay isolated and an edit is picked up at the next hook point. Missing files mean no hooks; discovery or parse failures are contained and deduplicated until the path or file version changes. An invalid regex reports its pattern and event. Only sync `type: 'command'` hooks run — a non-command or `async: true` hook is parsed-and-skipped with a warning. A hook accepts `timeout` or the `timeoutSec` alias; one that sets neither runs under the protocol's reference default (`DEFAULT_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS` from `dsh-hook-protocol`, 10 minutes). Events outside the five bridge-supported points are dropped at parse.

The hooks themselves run in the agent's session workspace: for the agent-scoped points the bridge passes the session's `cwd` as the hook process's working directory, so a hook operates in the user's project tree, not the server launch dir.

## Hook points → typed Decisions

| Codex hook | Harness point | Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | `agent/session-start` (emit) + first nonempty `agent/pre-step` | record the source at the emit, then await plain stdout or JSON additionalContext and fold it into the first entering request |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `agent/pre-step` (waterfall) | `block` (exit 2) → `PreStepDecision.reject`; additionalContext-only → delegate via `next()` then append a separately sourced message to a downstream `enter` decision |
| `PreToolUse` | `tools/pre-execute` (waterfall) | `block` → `PreToolDecision.deny` (no `allow`/`ask`) |
| `PostToolUse` | `tools/post-execute` (waterfall) | `block` → `block` with feedback; additionalContext-only → delegate via `next()` then prepend a separately sourced context to the downstream decision; Code Mode defers sub-call contexts until the outer `run_code` result |
| `Stop` | `agent/turn-stopping` (serial) | the first block in a turn feeds its reason through `steer()`; the next check reports `stop_hook_active: true` and cannot force another continuation |

A tool call's payload carries the real `tool_name` (the same value the matcher tests) and Codex's `tool_input: { command }` shape (the `command` arg when present, else `''`). The matcher subject is the tool name (`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`) or the session source (`SessionStart`); `UserPromptSubmit`/`Stop` ignore matchers.

Every agent-scoped stdin payload carries `session_id` and `transcript_path`. The bridge resolves the latter through `ctx.sessionPersistence.locate(session.header)` when available and otherwise sends `null`, preserving the Codex `string | null` shape. Lookup does not create or flush the artifact, so a path can be absent before the first turn-end checkpoint or omit the current open turn.

`SessionStart` records only its source at the emit. The first nonempty pre-step runs and awaits it before `UserPromptSubmit`, so its context reaches the first model request. Every point runs under the caller signal fused with the bridge lifetime and is tracked; disposing the bridge aborts still-running hook processes and waits for their run chains to settle (`createDetachedRuns` in `dsh-hook-protocol`).

## Context source

Injected context carries an explicit `{ kind: 'plugin', plugin: 'hooks-codex' }` source so the durable message is never mistaken for a user prompt.

## Model Experience

### Hook-provided context

#### What the model sees

`SessionStart`, accepted prompt, and post-tool hooks can add source-attributed context messages; a blocking `Stop` hook adds its reason as next-step steering.

#### Token effect

No cost when hooks return no context. Hook text is data-dependent, logged, and resent until compaction.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### Blocked prompt or tool outcome

#### What the model sees

Provider-supplied reasons pass through verbatim. When absent, a blocked prompt uses exactly `blocked by UserPromptSubmit hook`, a denied tool becomes `Error: blocked by PreToolUse hook`, blocked post-tool feedback is exactly `blocked by PostToolUse hook`, and a blocking stop adds steering exactly `continue: blocked by Stop hook`. Codex `systemMessage` is not surfaced.

#### Token effect

Blocking a prompt removes its request tokens; denial or feedback adds the retained fallback or provider text; forced continuation pays another full request.

#### KV Cache effect

A blocked prompt sends no request and invalidates nothing. Denial, feedback, and forced-continuation context append after the reusable prefix without rewriting it.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Unsupported hook events (5 of Codex's current 10):** `PermissionRequest`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SubagentStart`, and `SubagentStop`. Config for these events is silently dropped during parsing. The comparison baseline is Codex's [official hook reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks).
- **`SessionStart` is partial:** plain stdout and JSON `additionalContext` reach the first request, but `systemMessage` and `{"continue": false}` are not enforced.
- **`UserPromptSubmit` is partial:** blocking plus plain-stdout or JSON context work, but the common `systemMessage` and `{"continue": false}` controls are not enforced.
- **`PreToolUse` is partial:** blocking works, but `additionalContext`, `permissionDecision: "allow"`, and `updatedInput` are ignored. Every tool is represented as `tool_input: { command }`, so non-shell tool arguments are not faithfully exposed to the hook.
- **`PostToolUse` is partial:** blocking feedback and JSON `additionalContext` work, but `{"continue": false}` is not enforced, non-shell tool arguments are reduced to `{ command }`, and structured tool output is flattened to text in `tool_response`.
- **`Stop` is partial:** the first block forces one more model step and later checks in that turn receive `stop_hook_active: true`; a second block closes the turn instead of looping. `last_assistant_message` remains `null`, and `{"continue": false}` is not enforced.
- **Common payload and output fields are partial:** every mapped event reports the statically configured `model` and `permission_mode: "default"` instead of current Codex runtime values. `systemMessage` is logged + warned but not surfaced, and `{"continue": false}` is recorded but does not apply Codex's event-specific stop behavior (`TODO(hook-continue-false)`).
- **Config loading and execution are partial:** absolute shared or relative per-session project discovery selects one JSON file; Codex's merged user, session, system/managed, and plugin layers, trust controls, and inline `config.toml` hook form are not implemented. Only synchronous `command` handlers run, current metadata such as `statusMessage` and `commandWindows` is ignored, and matching handlers run serially rather than with Codex's concurrent launch semantics.
