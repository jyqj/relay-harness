English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Web Settings section `mcp` (order 18). The page presents managed MCP servers from `ctx.remote.mcpServers` plus read-only composition rows as a searchable catalog with one enablement filter and hairline rows. Host fiber phase is separate from configured enablement. Writable rows use a Switch plus edit and delete icon actions. A failed or unmounted enabled HTTP row shows Sign in, which calls `mcpServers.authorize`, opens the system browser, and re-lists when the Host has stored the bearer token and remounted. A connected row lists the public tool names registered for that server. The editor Modal switches between a form and a JSON object, preserves independent stdio and HTTP drafts, validates HTTP(S) URLs and every `KEY=value` line, and writes the managed document through `upsert` / `delete` / `setEnabled`. Refresh remounts managed rows whose connection supervisor has given up, then re-lists. While any row is connecting or reconnecting, the page polls `list`. Rows show live connection health and the last attempt error. The Host Remote owns persistence.

## Model Experience

None, as this browser Settings page registers no prompt, tool, message, or provider request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package never assembles model input.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **No marketplace or `.mcp.json` import** — add is a local form or JSON object only.
