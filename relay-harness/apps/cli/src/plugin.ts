/**
 * `dsh plugin --profile <name> <args...>` — profile plugin management as a
 * thin pnpm forwarder: initialize the profile on first use, run
 * `pnpm <args...>` in the profile directory, then reconcile the
 * `dsh.profile.bundles` layer list against the installed state (a dependency
 * resolving to a package that declares `dsh.bundle` joins the layer stack; a
 * removed or bundle-less dependency leaves it). Reconciling by installed
 * state, not by dependency diff, means `update` activates a package that
 * gained its `dsh.bundle` declaration in a newer version.
 *
 * Activation is fail-closed against the host-feature contract: a dependency
 * whose `dsh.compatibility` declaration is malformed, or whose required
 * features this dsh host does not support, never joins the layer stack (and
 * leaves it if it was active), `runPlugin` returns nonzero, and diagnostics
 * say exactly what to do. A package with no compatibility declaration is
 * untouched. A newly-added incompatible dependency is rolled back (removed
 * from the profile's dependencies — the exact undo of the `add` that just
 * ran); a pre-existing one stays installed but inactive, and the diagnostic
 * says so.
